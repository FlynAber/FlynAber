### Hi, I’m @FlynAber
- I’m interested in Cyber Security and programming with Python
- My main program is <a href="https://github.com/FlynAber/Exiled">Exiled</a>
- I'm always trying to find the time to add new features and learn more about Python and Cyber Security

### About Me
I started out with programming when I was still in school, just basic HTML, CSS and JS. However as my passion for programming grew bigger I found that I really enjoyed learning about the likes of cyber security and (white hat) hacking, I found myself watching videos and tutorials to learn more about programming languages. I have experimented with many languages such as Swift, VBS, C++, Java, and finally Python.

While I am realitvely new to Python I find that it is really easy to learn and code with thanks to all the available modules for it. Watching Python tutorials and hacking lectures from online courses let me really get a good handling of how python works and inspired me to create my first real program, <a href="https://github.com/FlynAber/Exiled">Exiled</a>. I found it fun and challenging at times to code different features into Exiled from scratch. Making this program really helped me to become a better programmer as features such as the wine installer was made entirely from scratch and the keylogger and screenshoting features were made without the help of online tutorials.

I want to continue updating these programs but it can be hard to find time sometimes. Check back every now and then to see if I've posted any new updates to my repositories.
